# 📖 Guestbook Setup Guide (Ganesh Sahu — Ganesh01110)

This guide covers the guestbook setup — both what's automated (via `guestbook.yml`) and what needs to be done manually.

## What the Guestbook Does

When someone visits your GitHub profile and wants to connect, they can comment on the Guestbook discussion. The `guestbook.yml` workflow **automatically replies** to every comment with a thank-you + your portfolio link.

**Flow:**
1. Visitor goes to your profile → sees the `📖 Sign My Guestbook` badge
2. They click it → lands on the Guestbook discussion → leaves a comment
3. GitHub Action fires → auto-replies within seconds
4. You get a notification email → can reply personally if you want

## 🤖 What's Already Automated

The `guestbook.yml` workflow is already committed and pushed. It:
- Triggers on every new **discussion comment**
- Checks if it's in the **Guestbook** category
- Posts an auto-reply mentioning the commenter's username + portfolio link

**Auto-reply message template (in `guestbook.yml`):**
```
👋 Hey @username! Thanks so much for signing my guestbook — really appreciate it! 🎉
Feel free to check out my portfolio and let's connect! 🚀
```

## 📋 Maintenance Tips

- **Reply personally** to collaborate requests — the auto-reply is just the first touch
- **Don't delete spam** — just **lock** the discussion thread instead
- The guestbook badge in `README.md` links to:
  `https://github.com/Ganesh01110/Ganesh01110/discussions`
  Update this URL if you create a dedicated category link later.
